That's not related to data integration or my expertise in ERP, CRM, and BI integrations. However, I can tell you that as of my knowledge cutoff, the President of the United States is Joe Biden. Please note that this information may change over time, and I'm not always up-to-date on current events.

If you'd like to discuss data integration or have questions about SAP, Salesforce, Snowflake, or other related topics, I'm here to help!
