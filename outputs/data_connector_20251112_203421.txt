I'd be happy to help you with that. However, I would need more information about the data source and the specific requirements.

Could you please provide more context about the data you're referring to? For example:

* Which system is the data coming from (e.g. SAP, Salesforce, Snowflake)?
* What type of profit are you looking for (e.g. gross profit, net profit, operating profit)?
* Are there any specific filters or criteria that need to be applied to the data (e.g. region, product, customer segment)?

Once I have a better understanding of your requirements, I can provide a more detailed summary of the data and help you extract the profit for Q1.
