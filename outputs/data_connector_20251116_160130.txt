**Q1 Loss Analysis and Data Integration Requirements**

**Background:**
The company has experienced a loss in Q1, and it's essential to analyze the data to identify the root causes and areas for improvement. To achieve this, we need to integrate data from various sources, including ERP, CRM, and BI systems.

**Data Sources:**

2. **Salesforce CRM System:**
	* Customer data (contact information, account history)
	* Sales performance data (opportunities, pipeline, conversion rates)
	* Marketing data (campaigns, leads, engagement metrics)
3. **Snowflake BI System:**
	* Analytical data (dashboards, reports, KPIs)
	* Data warehouse data (aggregated data from various sources)

**Data Integration Requirements:**

1. **Data Synchronization:**
	* Synchronize financial data from SAP ERP with Salesforce CRM to ensure accurate sales performance tracking.
	* Integrate inventory data from SAP ERP with Snowflake BI to analyze stock levels and material movements.
2. **Data Transformation:**
	* Transform sales data from Salesforce CRM into a format compatible with SAP ERP for accurate revenue recognition.
	* Convert procurement data from SAP ERP into a format suitable for analysis in Snowflake BI.
3. **Data Enrichment:**
	* Enrich customer data in Salesforce CRM with additional information from external sources (e.g., social media, market research).
	* Enhance analytical data in Snowflake BI with machine learning algorithms to predict future sales trends.
4. **Data Governance:**
	* Establish data quality checks to ensure accuracy and consistency across all data sources.
	* Implement data security measures to protect sensitive information.

**Summary:**
To analyze the Q1 loss, we need to integrate data from SAP ERP, Salesforce CRM, and Snowflake BI systems. The data integration requirements include data synchronization, transformation, enrichment, and governance. By integrating these data sources, we can gain a comprehensive understanding of the root causes of the loss and identify areas for improvement.
